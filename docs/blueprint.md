# **App Name**: Regen Hub

## Core Features:

- Intent Submission: Allow users to submit their regenerative actions with details like action type, date, location, participants, photos, and social media links via a web form.
- Tag Generation and Management: Automatically generate a unique tag/ID for each submitted intent and allow users to create a custom tag to associate their actions.
- Public Impact Wall: Display a public wall of verified regenerative actions with filters for city, action type, date, and tag/project name.
- Personal Impact Dashboard: Provide users with a personal dashboard to view their submitted actions, track their impact, and export reports.
- Data Export: Enable users to export their impact data in PDF or CSV format.
- Moderation: Allow administrators to verify, reject, or request more information for intent submissions, ensuring the quality of data displayed on the Impact Wall. Consider having an AI tool which attempts to discern false submissions to reduce the manual labor involved.
