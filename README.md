# Regen Impact

> Where Regenerative Action Becomes Verifiable Impact.

Regen Impact is an open-source platform designed to make local regenerative efforts visible, verifiable, and valuable. It addresses the challenge that countless positive environmental and social actions go unseen and unrecorded by providing tools to track, validate, and showcase this crucial work.

Our mission is to build a global, public registry of grassroots regenerative action, shifting the narrative from extractive to restorative and empowering individuals and communities to demonstrate their positive impact.

## The Problem

- **Invisibility:** Countless regenerative actions happen daily but remain invisible to the wider world.
- **Lack of Credibility:** Grassroots initiatives struggle to prove their impact, hindering their ability to gain support, funding, and recognition.
- **Fragmentation:** Isolated efforts lack a unified platform to connect, create a collective story, and demonstrate a larger movement.

## The Solution

Regen Impact provides a simple yet powerful framework to turn actions into trusted impact data.

- A **public, verifiable registry** of regenerative actions.
- A **hybrid validation system** combining AI pre-checks with human oversight to build trust.
- **Digital Impact Certificates** for each approved action, creating a shareable record of contribution.
- **Public profiles** for organizations and projects to showcase their verified track record.

## Key Features

- **Organization & Project Management:** Users can create and manage their own organizations and the projects within them.
- **Action Submission Wizard:** An intuitive, step-by-step guide to register new regenerative actions with descriptions, locations, and evidence.
- **AI-Assisted Validation:** Submissions are first analyzed by an AI assistant for completeness and potential flags, preparing them for efficient human review.
- **Admin Verification Panel:** A dedicated interface for administrators to review, score, and approve submitted actions, certifying them.
- **Public Impact Wall:** A global map and feed showcasing all verified regenerative actions, filterable by category and location.
- **Certificate & Profile Pages:** Every action and organization has a unique, shareable public page to display their verified impact.
- **LEAP Module for SMEs:** A guided assessment based on the TNFD framework to help Small and Medium-sized Enterprises understand and manage their dependencies and impacts on nature.

## How It Works

1.  **Create Identity:** A user signs up and creates an Organization and a Project.
2.  **Submit Action:** The user performs a regenerative action and uses the wizard to submit a report with details and evidence (e.g., a link to a photo or blog post).
3.  **AI Pre-Check:** A Genkit AI flow automatically analyzes the submission, provides a summary, suggests a score, and flags potential issues.
4.  **Human Verification:** An administrator reviews the AI analysis and the submission details, assigning a final score and approving the action.
5.  **Certification:** Upon approval, a permanent digital Impact Certificate is created for the action.
6.  **Showcase Impact:** The verified action appears on the Public Impact Wall and the organization's public profile, contributing to their track record.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Database & Auth:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
- **Generative AI:** [Genkit (Google AI)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **UI:** [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Components:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Deployment:** Firebase App Hosting

## API Endpoints

The application exposes several serverless API routes for handling core functionality:

- `POST /api/submit`: Submits a new action. Requires authentication. Kicks off the AI verification flow.
- `GET /api/wall`: Retrieves verified actions for the public Impact Wall.
- `GET /api/org/[slug]`: Retrieves a specific organization's public profile and its verified actions.
- `GET /api/action/[actionId]`: Retrieves the data for a specific certified action.

## Roadmap

This is just the beginning. Our vision is to evolve Regen Impact into a core piece of public infrastructure for the regenerative movement.
